## Installation

You need [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/) (Python Dependency Manager) to setup the project.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simplicity
   ```

2. Install dependencies using PDM:
   ```bash
   pdm install
   ```

3. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.toml config.toml
   ```

4. Edit `config.toml` and add your API keys:
   - **Jina API Key**: Required for web search functionality
   - **OpenRouter API Key**: Required for LLM model access

   Example:
   ```toml
   jina_api_key="your-jina-api-key-here"
   
   [providers.openrouter]

## Engine Configuration

The project is designed to be extensible with different engines that run the search in different ways. Currently the project have only the `pardo` engine, which do RAG on every single source and finally summarize the results.
